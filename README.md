Do you have conflicts on Rector install? You're in the right place. Prefixed Rector can [be installed even on very old Symfony](https://getrector.org/blog/2020/01/20/how-to-install-rector-despite-composer-conflicts).

Do you have older PHP? Rector prefixed goes down to PHP 7.1, so you can install it even on older projects.

## Install

```bash
composer require rector/rector-prefixed --dev
```

```bash
# generate "rector.php" config
vendor/bin/rector init

# dry run
vendor/bin/rector process src --dry-run

# changing run
vendor/bin/rector process src
```
