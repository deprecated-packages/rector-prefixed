# Prefixed Rector

Since Rector 0.11, the prefixed version is now released in `rector/rector` by default. It works the same way as this package.

See [Prefixed Rector by Default](https://getrector.org/blog/prefixed-rector-by-default).


## How to Upgrade?

```bash
composer remove rector/rector-prefixed
composer require rector/rector:^0.11 --dev
```
